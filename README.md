`go-msgraph` is a go lang implementation of the Microsoft Graph API. See [Overview of Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/overview)

## General

This implementation has been written to get various user, group and calendar details out of a Microsoft Azure Active Directory. Currently only READ-access is implemented, but you are welcome to add WRITE-support to it & backmerge it.

## Features

working & tested:

- list users, groups, calendars, calendarevents, domains, devices
- automatically grab & refresh token for API-access
- json-load the GraphClient struct & initialize it
- set timezone for full-day CalendarEvent
- use `$select`, `$search`, `$filter` and `$expand` when querying data
- `context`-aware API calls, can be cancelled.
- loading huge data sets with paging, thanks to PR #20 - [@Goorsky123](https://github.com/Goorsky123)

planned:

- String func that only prints non-empty values of an object, e.g. User
- add further support for mail, personal contacts (outlook), devices and apps, files etc. See [https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/v1-overview](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/v1-overview)

## Example

To get your credentials to access the Microsoft Graph API visit: [Register an application with Azure AD and create a service principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#register-an-application-with-azure-ad-and-create-a-service-principal)

More examples can be found at the [docs](docs/). Here's a brief summary of some of the most common API-queries, ready to copy'n'paste:

````go
// initialize GraphClient manually
graphClient, err := msgraph.NewGraphClient("<TenantID>", "<ApplicationID>", "<ClientSecret>")
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Credentials are probably wrong or system time is not synced: ", err)
}

// List all users
users, err := graphClient.ListUsers()
// Gets all the detailled information about a user identified by it's ID or userPrincipalName
user, err := graphClient.GetUser("humpty@contoso.com")
// List all groups
groups, err := graphClient.ListGroups()
// List all members of a group.
groupMembers, err := groups[0].ListMembers()
// Lists all Calendars of a user
calendars, err := user.ListCalendars()
// List all domains
domains, err := graphClient.ListDomains()
// List all devices
devices, err := graphClient.ListDevices()

// Let all full-day calendar events that are loaded from ms graph be set to timezone Europe/Vienna:
// Standard is time.Local
msgraph.FullDayEventTimeZone, _ = time.LoadLocation("Europe/Vienna")

// Lists all CalendarEvents of the given userPrincipalName/ID that starts/ends within the the next 7 days
startTime := time.Now()
endTime := time.Now().Add(time.Hour * 24 * 7)
events, err := graphClient.ListCalendarView("alice@contoso.com", startTime, endTime)

## Versioning & backwards compatibility

This project uses [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) with all tags prefixed with a `v`. Altough currently the case, I cannot promise to really keep everything backwards compatible for the 0.x version. If a 1.x version of this repository is ever released with enough API-calls implemented, I will keep this promise for sure. Any Breaking changes will be marked as such in the release notes of each release.

## Installation

I recommend to use [go modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules) and always use the latest tagged [release](https://github.com/open-networks/go-msgraph/releases). You may directly download the source code there, but the preffered way to install and update is with `go get`:

```shell
# Initially install
go get github.com/open-networks/go-msgraph
# Update
go get -u github.com/open-networks/go-msgraph
go mod tidy
```

## Documentation

There is some example code placed in the [docs/](docs/) folder. The code itself is pretty well documented with comments, hence see [http://godoc.org/github.com/open-networks/go-msgraph](http://godoc.org/github.com/open-networks/go-msgraph) or run:

```shell
godoc github.com/open-networks/go-msgraph
```
